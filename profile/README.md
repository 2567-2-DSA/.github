<br>The grading allows a runtime of only 20 seconds (on the grading machine). If it exceeds the timeout (> 20 seconds), it will result in a RunScript failure. 
<br>The challenge in HW3 is to optimize it for faster running time.

<br>For HW5, you are required to study and submit the code we covered in class (`ex04.c`). Submit it as `homework.c`, replacing the existing `homework.c` in the repository.

# Check the Homework/Classwork Grading
Your task is to implement code based on the assignment questions/instructions. If anything is unclear, you must ask for clarification.
Do not assume that simply checking the homework and saying “OK” guarantees a correct answer.

Check the Homework/Classwork (['hw1','hw2','hw3','hw4','hw5']) grading at [http://hw.let.rocks/](http://hw.let.rocks/).
<br>The provided link is only for reference to the final result (and for discussion with me if you strongly believe you are correct).

The test cases here are designed to verify your work and align with the assignment questions. They also serve as hidden test cases that you are not meant to see.
